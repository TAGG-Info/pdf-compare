# Contributing to pdf-compare

Thank you for your interest in contributing to pdf-compare! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TAGG-Info/pdf-compare.git
   cd pdf-compare
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. **Verify installation**

   ```bash
   pdf-compare --version
   pytest
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
   - Add docstrings to functions and classes
   - Update tests if needed

3. **Test your changes**

   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   pytest

   # Run tests with coverage
   pytest --cov=pdf_compare

   # Run specific test file
   pytest tests/test_comparator.py -v
   ```

4. **Format your code**

   ```bash
   # Auto-format with black
   black src/

   # Check for linting issues
   flake8 src/

   # Type checking
   mypy src/
   ```

### Commit Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add feature to compare PDF annotations

- Implement annotation extraction
- Add tests for annotation comparison
- Update documentation
```

Commit message format:
- First line: Brief summary (50 chars max)
- Blank line
- Detailed description if needed

## Code Standards

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable names

**Good:**
```python
def calculate_similarity_percentage(self, img1: Image.Image, img2: Image.Image) -> float:
    """Calculate the percentage of similarity between two images"""
    total_pixels = img1.width * img1.height * 3
    return ((total_pixels - diff_pixels) / total_pixels) * 100
```

**Bad:**
```python
def calc(i1, i2):
    t = i1.width * i1.height * 3
    return ((t - d) / t) * 100
```

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Update README.md for user-facing changes

**Example:**
```python
def compare_images(self, img1: Image.Image, img2: Image.Image) -> Tuple[bool, Image.Image, int]:
    """
    Compare two images and generate a diff image

    Args:
        img1: First image
        img2: Second image

    Returns:
        Tuple of (are_identical, diff_image, diff_pixel_count)

    Raises:
        ValueError: If images have different dimensions
    """
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

**Test structure:**
```python
class TestNewFeature:
    """Tests for new feature"""

    def test_basic_functionality(self):
        """Test basic use case"""
        # Arrange
        comparator = PDFComparator()

        # Act
        result = comparator.new_feature()

        # Assert
        assert result is not None
```
